# msrisitas
msrisitas is a troll virus (not dangerous). 

It has been created to be installed on machines from a USB stick. 


The files must all be in the root of the flash drive. 

To install it and launch it on the victim's machine, you have to open the file "launch.bat" and wait for paint to run, then you can eject the USB stick, 
it won't be useful anymore because msrisitas is a persistent virus.  


To remove the virus from the PC, you must delete the folder named "msrisitas" in %appdata%, 
and then delete the shortcut named "msrisitas. vbs" in %appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start MenuPrograms\Startup, 
then empty the trash. 
The virus has been removed from the computer.
